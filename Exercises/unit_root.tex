In our previous exercises, we plotted the data series and qualitatively judged whether they look stationary or not. In this exercise, we will check them formally using ADF test.

\input{../Tex-files-manual/ADF-H0_H1-table.tex}

Now, let us return to the exercise: Check whether the following time series are stationary.\footnote{The following solutions are heavily based on \cite[][see page 501-504]{Hamilton-1994}}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=--]
    \item \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
              \item \verb|CLVMNACSCAB1GQDE.csv|: Real Gross Domestic Product for Germany; from FRED; seasonally adjusted; Quarterly; Millions of Chained 2010 Euros

                    \begin{sol}
                        Due to population growth and technological progress, we would expect positive upward trend in real gdp, as also seen in the figure.

                        The question is whether this trend arises from a unit root process with drift term:
                        \[ H_0: y_t = \alpha + y_{t-1} + u_t, \quad \alpha > 0\]
                        or from a deterministic time trend:
                        \[
                            H_1: y_t = \alpha + \delta t + \rho y_{t-1} + u_t,
                            \quad |\rho| < 1
                        \]

                        Therefore, for the situation here, the test case 4 is suitable.
                    \end{sol}

              \item Transform the \emph{GDP} into \emph{growth rate} using the formula below: \[ g_t = 100 (Y_t / Y_{t-1} - 1) \] where $g_t$ is growth rate, $Y_t$ is seasonally adjusted real GDP.

                    \begin{sol}
                        We would expect GDP growth to move around a constant level, as the figure below also confirms.

                        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figs/gdp_growth_tsplot.pdf}

                        The question is whether this arises from a unit root
                        \[ H_0: y_t = y_{t-1} + u_t \]
                        or from a stationary process around a constant
                        \[
                            H_1: y_t = \alpha + \rho y_{t-1} + u_t,
                            \quad |\rho| < 1
                        \]

                        Thus, the case 2 is suitable here.
                    \end{sol}
