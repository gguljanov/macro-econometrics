  abstract  = {Summary This chapter summarizes some of the well-known definitions and theorems of matrix algebra. A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. Sometimes a set can be defined by displaying the elements in braces. Schur's theorem tells that there exists, for every square matrix A , a unitary matrix S which ‘transforms’ A into an upper triangular matrix M whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of A . Jordan's theorem similarly states that there exists a nonsingular matrix, say T , which transforms A into an upper triangular matrix M whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of A . The difference between the two decomposition theorems is that in Jordan's theorem less structure is put on the matrix T and more structure on the matrix M. Matrices and vectors are assumed to be real, unless it is explicitly specified that they are complex. Symmetric matrix functions are always defined through their eigenvalues.}
