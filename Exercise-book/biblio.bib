  abstract = {In this paper, we analyse Okun’s law—a relation between the change in the unemployment rate and GDP growth—using data from Australia, the euro area, the UK and the USA. More specifically, we assess the relevance of non-Gaussianity when modelling the relation. This is done in a Bayesian VAR framework with stochastic volatility where we allow the different models’ error distributions to have heavier-than-Gaussian tails and skewness. Our results indicate that accounting for heavy tails yields improvements over a Gaussian specification in some cases, whereas skewness appears less fruitful. In terms of dynamic effects, a shock to GDP growth has robustly negative effects on the change in the unemployment rate in all four economies.}

  abstract  = {Summary This chapter develops some matrix tools that will prove useful to us later. The vec operator transforms a matrix into a vector by stacking its columns one underneath the other. The chapter shows that the Kronecker product and the vec operator are intimately connected. It discusses the Moore-Penrose (MP) inverse, which generalizes the concept of the inverse of a nonsingular matrix to singular square matrices and rectangular matrices. The inverse of a matrix is defined when the matrix is square and nonsingular. For many purposes, it is useful to generalize the concept of invertibility to singular matrices and, indeed, to matrices that are not square. One such generalization that is particularly useful because of its uniqueness is the Moore-Penrose inverse.}

  abstract  = {Summary This chapter summarizes some of the well-known definitions and theorems of matrix algebra. A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. Sometimes a set can be defined by displaying the elements in braces. Schur's theorem tells that there exists, for every square matrix A , a unitary matrix S which ‘transforms’ A into an upper triangular matrix M whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of A . Jordan's theorem similarly states that there exists a nonsingular matrix, say T , which transforms A into an upper triangular matrix M whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of A . The difference between the two decomposition theorems is that in Jordan's theorem less structure is put on the matrix T and more structure on the matrix M. Matrices and vectors are assumed to be real, unless it is explicitly specified that they are complex. Symmetric matrix functions are always defined through their eigenvalues.}
